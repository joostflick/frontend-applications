# Prototype risk indicator

> risk indicator

## Build Setup

The core program was build using the vue cli, with the vue create command

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Dependencies

I used the following dependencies in my application

### Babel

Make sure my newer code runs in all browsers

### Uglify

Compress the code so it takes less space and runs faster

### Browserify

So I can use requires and imports without having to build every time

### Vueify

In addition to browserify, for vue.js components

For more information see the [docs for vueify](https://github.com/vuejs/vueify).

### Watchify

Hot reload so I can see my changes as fast as possible

## The idea

An application to determine the risk for a child to later be placed outside of parental custody

## Core functionality

#### Risk indication

Fill in the questions to get a risk indication, this live reloads everytime a question is answered

#### Second Opinion

Still in a conceptual phase. Upload your risk assesment for other people to view and rate, so you aren't alone in your decisions.
